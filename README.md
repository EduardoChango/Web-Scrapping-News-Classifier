# Web Scraping Automation and Classifier

This project was made thinking about to exploid data by ourselves, through web scraping and use it as input to a LLM to make quick analysis.

- Get a bunch of news summaries from CNN, New York Times, Cybersecurity Magazine
- Classify each one in preestablished categories using a Large Languaje Model, based on the title and the description of the new

In the future: Since the most relevant news selected by user, create new scraper bots to dive deep in to the new to catch more information to be used to assit user to create digital content for different media platforms

## Enviroment Variables

Once the code is cloned, change the name of the .env_temp to .env. You should provide the API_KEY of your OpenAI project, and the Assistant Idetifier, with the prompt to accomplish the classifying task.



## Lessons Learned

- Since I learned about front end, This project was useful to learn more about use browser developer tools and locate object into a web page.
- Also I learned more about to use chat gpt from their API, and prompt engineering.
